description=This plugin provides tools for clustered and hierarchical visualization of vector layers, creation of Relief Shading and management of scales using zoom levels.
version=0.1

email=guilhermealexs.pereira@gmail.com

about=This plugin offers tools to help you create webmaps.

 1. Avoid showing hundreds of features at once! Use the dynamic (zoom level dependant), hierarchical, and cluster or grid-based engines provided by the plugin.
 2. Apply the Aerial Perspective effect to control the contrast of your hillshade.
 3. Create a special Relief Shading that gives more detail to the terrain while softening the visual aspect.
 4. Set the visibility of your layers or group of layers using zoom levels instead of scales.
 5. Change scale using a zoom level selector.
